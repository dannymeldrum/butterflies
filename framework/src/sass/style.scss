/* 
* Style.scss
*
* Numiko Framework
*
* The order of files reflects the natural CSS cascade of specificity. We start with global vairables and work down to the most specific classes.
* 
* 
* 
* [1]  Frameworks
* 		- External framrworks, Susy, Breakpoint and other SCSS systems.If you are using a framrwork, include it directly rather than a GEM.
* [2]  Config
* 		- Vairables at a global level, grid settings and font and colour vairables required for the site.
* [3]  Core
* 		- Mixinss, normalise and helper classes. Only mixins in the mixin file, helpers should comprise only of classes.
* [4]  Base
* 		- Typography, lists, forms, tables. Basic styling WITHOUT classes.
* [5]  Vendor
* 		- Vendor CSS from plugins or other frameworks.
* [6]  Layout
* 		- The core site layout based on grids and breakpoints.
* [7]  Objects
* 	    - Object abstractions that combine often repeated layouts.
* [8]  Components
* 	    - The primary elements of the site, created from objects and layouts, 
*         these define the elements that reflect the design and UI of the site.
* [9]  States
* 	    - Page based alterations to the layout, design or UI.
* [10] Temp
* 	    - Styles that are either temporary during developlent or require work to re-factor a more appropriate
* 	      part of the framework.
